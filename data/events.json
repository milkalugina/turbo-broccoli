    "eventSummary": "Bridge hacks accounted for 69% of all stolen crypto funds in 2022, totaling nearly $2 billion. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in complex smart contracts and multi-signature wallets used by bridges like Force Bridge, which lock assets on one blockchain and mint equivalent tokens on another. State-sponsored groups, such as the Lazarus Group, have been linked to high-profile bridge hacks, including the $620 million Ronin network breach. The complexity of cross-chain interactions increases the risk of such attacks."
